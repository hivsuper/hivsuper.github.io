Previously I usually make notes in my diary or online note software, thus information is decentralized. I decide to create this page to place stuffs together here in future.  

## C4 model
The [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) provide various of good practises in architect.  
1. A set of hierarchical abstractions (software systems, containers, components, and code).  
1. A set of hierarchical diagrams (system context, containers, components, and code).  
1. Notation independent.  

The page also has listed some fantastic tools. Though I'm a big fan of [gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/), I also like [structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) which can even export to Mermaid to use for Markdown notes.
